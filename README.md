* Character creation
* Game Loop
* ActionHandler
* WorldSimulation
* WorldNavigation
* StoryBlock Indexing and Navigation
* Simple ASCII Renderer

## The Game Engine

The game engine will be quite light-weight and will support some basic game mechanics.
It should be easily extendable and give the developer a nice set of tools to create and develop story based gaming experiences within a console environment.

## In the long term

It would be cool if the engine was built in such a way that it would be easy to connect it's output to a more rich graphics environment in the future.
That it's easy to develop and convert earlier games into a more immersive experience.

## Playground / Sandbox

It's a cool way to explore C# and just play around with different things within the area of game design / developent. It would be cool to test out some
generative world things in the longrun. Having these things in C# makes it easy to convert to engines like Unity.

## RPG Advanced mode

I'm getting a bit excited about the whole project, I want to expand the functionality and make it a lightweight RPG system. This includes some of the listed things:

* Character (Stats, Equipment, Info, Bio)
* Inventory
* Quest Journal
* Worldmap
* Localmap
* Fight Scene
* Barter

An RPG system will be a bit more advanced, and I will need to work within a set resolution to make it possible, I need to see how it looks on a windows console, the mac console I can resize manually. Maybe there's a way to do this in code as well, I need to look into that.
