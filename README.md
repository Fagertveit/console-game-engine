## The Game Engine

The game engine will be quite light-weight and will support some basic game mechanics.
It should be easily extendable and give the developer a nice set of tools to create and develop story based gaming experiences within a console environment.

## In the long term

It would be cool if the engine was built in such a way that it would be easy to connect it's output to a more rich graphics environment in the future.
That it's easy to develop and convert earlier games into a more immersive experience.

## Playground / Sandbox

It's a cool way to explore C# and just play around with different things within the area of game design / developent. It would be cool to test out some
generative world things in the longrun. Having these things in C# makes it easy to conver to engines like Unity.
